The file named "Cue" is a file compatible with the lighting desk, so it would be usable within the menu for reading Cue file from desk.

The file named The Visit Cues - Lighting.tsv is the tsv table of cues that can be imported using the import tsv table section in the program menu.

When exporting from the program the output file will be named "Cue" and be saevd in the same directory as the .exe, so it will overwrite any other files named "Cue"

Alongside the testing log hand in is the video showing how these files work.
